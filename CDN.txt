CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. It's a network of servers distributed across different locations that work together to deliver web content (like images, videos, JavaScript, CSS files, and HTML pages) to users more efficiently.

Key Features of CDNs:
Faster Load Times: By caching content on servers closer to users, CDNs reduce latency and improve website speed.
Reduced Bandwidth Costs: Offloading traffic to CDN servers reduces the load on your origin server, saving bandwidth costs.
Improved Reliability: CDNs handle high traffic volumes and mitigate server failures by distributing the load.
Enhanced Security: Many CDNs provide security features such as DDoS protection, secure token authentication, and encryption.
Examples of Popular CDN Providers:
Akamai
Cloudflare
Amazon CloudFront
Google Cloud CDN
Microsoft Azure CDN
